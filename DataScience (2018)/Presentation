## Experiment

The following presentation show results from an experiment to compare yields (as measured by dried weight of plants) obtained under a control and two different treatments conditions.

- **Raw data**
```{r, comment=""}
show(PlantGrowth)
```
## Paramethers
- **General mean**
```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
mean(PlantGrowth$weight)
```
- **Control mean and variance**
```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
mean(PlantGrowth$weight[1:10])
var(PlantGrowth$weight[1:10])
```

- **Treatment 1 mean and variance**
```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
mean(PlantGrowth$weight[11:20])
var(PlantGrowth$weight[11:20])
```

- **Treatment 2 mean and variance**
```{r, echo=FALSE, comment=""}
mean(PlantGrowth$weight[21:30])
var(PlantGrowth$weight[21:30])
```

## Plot

Check out the app for 4 extra visualization options: https://setito.shinyapps.io/Week4Shiny/

```{r}
plot(PlantGrowth$group, PlantGrowth$weight, xlab = "Treatment", ylab = "Weight", main = "Plant growth vs treatments", col=13)
```





## Conclusions
1. Treatment 1 reduces the average plant growth.
    + 0,37 kg compared with the absence of treatment and 0,87 kg compared with treatment 2.
2. Treatment 2 increases the average plant growth.
    + 0,49 kg compared with the absence of treatment and 0,87 kg compared with treatment 1.
3. Treatment 1 has an equalizer effect and treatment 2, the opposite.
    + In treatment 1, the variance it is almost the double than in control group and more than the triple than with treatment 2.
